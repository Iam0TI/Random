# My Implementation of the EIP20 Standard for ERC20 Tokens

### This was a fun experience learning how to implement ERC20 Tokens from scratch. I was able to learn about token approval and token allowance.

TODO: Write tests, and I think there is a problem with the approval mechanism.

Check out the standard  [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)
